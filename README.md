## How to play Word Bash

In Word Bash, you are given a pool of random letters which you use to make words.

Choose your game size to determine how many letter tiles you want to play with.

To win, you must use all the letter tiles in the pool.

You cannot use the same word twice; each word accepted must be unique.

Click on a word you have already accepted to remove it and return those letters to the pool. 

You are awarded points based on the length of your accepted words - try to get as many long words as you can!
